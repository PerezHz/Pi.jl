# π in Julia

This notebook is a collection of snippets of Julia code in some way involve π. If I
collect enough, I will post it to the Julia blog for π day (March 14th).

## Contributing

I am actively seeking contributions. Each snippet should either demonstrate something
interesting: either about π, Julia or even something completely different (as long as it
involves π and Julia in some way).

Please remove all output from the notebook before making a PR (this can be done via `make
clear`).
